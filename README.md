# To-Do
 Todo App with React  Integrating Meteor and React

In this project we will build a simple to-do tasks app using React with the Meteor platform.

### Step 1.1: Create Meteor Project

First we need to install Meteor and the easiest way to setup Meteor with React is by using the command:

```js 
meteor create --react simple-todos-react
```
After this command is run, Meteor will create several boilerplate files for you.

These are the files responsible for bootstrapping your client user interface:

For now you don't need to worry about the files located in the client directory.

You can run your Meteor app using:

``` js
meteor run
```
